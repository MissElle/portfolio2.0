						<p>Elle Pope is small home Wisconsin living in big city Seattle. They are a creator who strives for the functional, the bizarre, and the new. From programming to illustration, they enjoy creating in a multitude of media.</p>
						<p>Elle's ultimate passion is in interactive systems, such as application development, video games, virtual reality, and comics and books (although all reading is interactive, this is more referring to augmented reality and interactive story novels). These systems have the capacity to foster a positive environment as well as promote critical thinking. This is why they started Poly entertainment, a company that creates Multimedia Interactive Systems (MISs) that strive to promote diversity, truth, and the abstruse. The primary goal of the company is to explore the possibilities of computer science and interaction, whilst harboring a positive community.</p>
						<p>Beyond their work, Elle enjoys hanging out with friends and starting projects with others. Beyond socialization, they enjoy reading, running, playing with inks, and keeping up with sociological/anthropological studies and trends.

							<h3>~Secret Bio about Elle~</h3>
							<p>Ultimately, I have a lot of passion in what I do. I strive for excellency in everything and due to this, I am also a very busy person. So, please keep your questions short!</p>
							<p>Truth be told, I do not care what pronouns you call me, and I refer to myself as "they" in my about section to explain myself best. I am gender queer and I actually prefer that people call me by the pronouns they are most comfortable calling me.</p>
							<p>Favorite Animals are rats and crows!</p>
